[{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Home"},{"content":" Check out Nui Engine on Github With the project files now generated, we can start writing engine code. Every game engine needs a logging and error catching framework. Here is how I designed one for Nui Engine (with pseudocode).\nLogging # Log Levels # Every log message will have a verbosity level. Which is defined using an enumeration.\nenum class LogLevel { Debug, // For low level engine information Info, // For general information Warn, // For warnings Error, // For errors Fatal, // Similar to \u0026#39;Error\u0026#39;, also gives a stacktrace Exception // Similar to \u0026#39;Error\u0026#39;, also gives a stacktrace and crashes the program } LogEntry # Each log message will be wrapped in a LogEntry structure which contains additional information regarding the log message.\nstruct LogEntry { LogLevel Level; // Log level of the message String Category; // Log category of the message String Message; // The log message to display TimePoint Time; // Time point of log message Stacktrace Stacktrace; // The stacktrace to the location of log message } Since I am using C++23 for this project I have access to std::stacktrace which is what I am using to generate my stacktrace. There is also a header only stacktrace library called backward-cpp which contains a bunch of additional features. Although I did not use it here since I want the engine to have minimal external dependencies.\nLog File # Since I plan to use this engine with Visual Studio, I am going to use the VS Output Window as my log message output window. I will also be using a log file in case someone is not using Visual Studio (presently external debggers already hook into the OutputDebugString function using which the log message can also be viewed in the debuggers output window).\nI also created an internal structure called a LogFile which can be opened and closed using helper functions. To which the same formatted log message can be appended.\nThe log file resides in the \u0026lt;WorkingDir\u0026gt;/Saved/NuiEngine.log\nPrinting the Log # To print the log I have a function called Log which takes a LogEntry and formats it and prints it out.\nvoid Nui::Log(const LogEntry\u0026amp; entry) { // Make formatted log message from entry // Append time, category and verbosity with the message String formattedMsg = ... ; // Redirects string to output window and file (if opened) LogOut(formattedMsg); if (entry.Level == LogLevel::Fatal) { // Format and print the stacktrace to the output window/file PrintStacktrace(entry.Stacktrace); } } Although I do not want the user to directly use this function or create a LogEntry manually everytime they want to log something. So I made a wrapper macro.\n// The LogEntry constructor default initializes the stacktrace from this point #define NUI_LOG(Level, Category, Message) Nui::Log::Log(Nui::Log::LogEntry(Nui::Log::LogLevel::Level, #Category, Message)) Here is how the log message looks like in debug build (I have an extension called VSColorOutput enabled which highlights my output messages).\nLog test output in VS output window Assertions # Instead of using the default assert provided by C++. I wanted to make my own assert that makes use of LogLevel::Exception.\nI made a the following Assert function\nvoid Assert(bool condition, StringView conditionString, StringView message, StringView file, I32 line, Stacktrace trace) { if (!condition) { // Build a log message using the condition string and message String logMsg = ... ; // Create a log entry with level set to exception Log(LogEntry(LogLevel::Exception, ...)); // Manually print the trace PrintStackTrace(trace); // Crash the program throw std::runtime_error(\u0026#34;Assertion failed!\u0026#34;); } } Assertions in Nui are meant to be used using this macro\n#if NUI_DEBUG #define NUI_ASSERT(Condition, Message) Nui::Log::Assert(Condition, #Condition, Message, __FILE__, __LINE__) #else #define NUI_ASSERT(Condition, Message) #endif Here you can see the output window with the formatted message when an assertion fails, along with the stacktrace and file/line.\nOutput window when an assertion fails Conclusion # I would like to add the ability to set the log verbosity level. But at the time of development, I\u0026rsquo;d rather have all the log message printed so this is something we can come back to in the future. I\u0026rsquo;d also want to make the logging system multithreaded.\nOnce I have some Win32 specific functionality added in, I\u0026rsquo;d also like to show a message box when the program fails an assert in release mode such that the end user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to go through the created log file to find out why the program crashed.\nAs usual the complete source code for this project is available on my GitHub repository (see top of page).

These will be defined manually and will not change during project generation. I also include the premake5.exe with the repository.\nIn the Scripts folder there are also premake template files for the solution and user project that the python script will use when creating a project.\nCreating a New Project # To create a new project the user will have to run Scripts/CreateProject.py with the project name as the command line argument. The goal is to run this script only once when the project has to be created for the first time.\nUsing Python # I decided to use python since it\u0026rsquo;s super easy to easy to write and can be executed on the fly. This is what the Python script does:\nTakes the user project name as an command line argument Usage (cmd): CreateProject.py -projectname=\u0026lt;USER_PROJECT_NAME\u0026gt; Creates project directory in the root folder Creates the Build\u0026lt;USER_PROJECT_NAME\u0026gt;.lua using the PremakeProjectTemplate.lua file in the project directory Creates a sub folder in the project directory with the same name as the project. This is where the user code will be written. Calls premake5.exe to generate the Visual Studio solution and project files Generating Project Files # There is also a batch script in the root folder called GenerateProjectFiles.bat. Which invokes premake5.exe and can be used to update the project and solution when new files are added.\nWith this system I can also create GitHub actions to run the tests automatically.\nWith all that done, we now have a project generated with the right links.

Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve got the itch to make another game engine from scratch and I figured, why not bring you along for the ride?\nSo, here we are! I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to make use of this blog space on my website to document my journey of yet another game engine.\nWhy Document This Journey? # You see, I have a habit of starting projects and abandoning them halfway through. My last documented project was the game engine I made in my final year of university. Since then I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to make at least 4 other game engines which have never seen the light of day and all are sitting in private repos. They all have an explosive start, but I end up abandoning them a couple months into the project.\nBut not this time! I will use this blog basically as an excuse to hold myself accountable with regular updates and posts, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stay on track and see this thing through to the end (hopefully 🤞).\nWhat to expect # Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing everything, from brainstorming sessions, to engine architecture, design decisions and fun C++ tidbits. Some posts might be code-heavy, other might be small bite-sized articles. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how things go :D\nAnd Finally # Hopefully, the future articles are helpful and enjoyable to read. Keeping in mind it\u0026rsquo;s also my first time writing blogs of any kind, so there is definitly some room for improvement.\nI hope you\u0026rsquo;ll stick around for the development of this new project 😄.\nCatch ya around!\nProgramming Game Engine ","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/mage0/","section":"Posts","summary":"Humble beginnings - documenting my journey making a game engine","title":"Making a Game Engine - Part 0"},{"content":" Procrastinating my next project with many unfinished ones in front of me!

For this project I research what goes into making a game engine and try to implement my learnings. Written in C++ 20, DirectX 11 and HLSL and based on and ECS and event-driven architecture. The editor is also written in C++ using ImGui. It also supports entity scripting using Lua.\nCheck out the project repository on Github. Watch the demo video here\nArchitecture # The project consists of two sub projects - The Engine and the The Editor. The engine compiles to a static library (.lib) and the editor compiles to an executable (.exe)\nProximity Engine Architecture Proximity\u0026rsquo;s architecture is inspired from Hazel and the initialization chain is inspired from Unreal Engine.\nProximity Engine Initialization Chain Engine Features # Watch the demo video Here are the key features of the engine, some of which are explained in detail after:\nWindow and Input Handling Audio Engine using XAudio2 Custom math library Event driven architecture using Actions Graphics engine and rendering using DirectX 11 Filesystem and directory management Engine logging system Engine utilities Asset libraries (Audio, Shaders, Material, Textures, Scripts) Memory managers (Stack and Pool Allocators) Detailed HLSL shader reflection Scripting using Lua Physics using Box2D Game/Project Serialization using Yaml-Cpp Multiple scenes and project management Entity Component System using ENTT Proximity Editor HLSL Shader Reflection # One of the most impressive features of the game engine is the shader reflection system. The user can write any HLSL code (vertex or pixel shader). The shader is then compiled and reflected within in the engine. The user can then create a Material which is a pair of vertex and pixel shaders. This material is then reflected in the editor; constant buffers and input resource slots can be manually edited from within the editor\nShader reflection system Actions # I recreated the System.Action\u0026lt;\u0026gt; class from C# in C++ 20. And this is what drives the communicatation between the engine and the editor and between the different editor panels.\nThe user can create custom action events (which may or may not take arguments) and bind their own functions/lamdas to these actions. Whenever an action is called, all the bound functions to this action are also called.\nLua Scripting # The engine supports entity scripting using Lua and the Sol2 library. The engine creates a custom runtime environment for each script in the game. The user can call functions to and from C++ and Lua and all of this is made easy using the Sol2 library. The scripts are written in the built in script editor which also has support for syntax hightlighting for engine specific functions.\nConclusion # During this project, I learnt so many new things about C++, HLSL, DirectX 11 as a whole. I believe I have built this project to be the showcase of my skills a C++ and engine programmer and is definitely will be the highlight project of my portfolio along with being the most complex project I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on till date. With some changes to the project and scope, I will definitely make Proximity 2.0, which will be faster with even more supported features.\nI did not talk about the intricate details about all the features of this project or this would turn into a 30 minute long article.

And in that list, there were two main ones. GOAP and Neural Networks, specifically NEAT and Genetic Algorithms. Although my original plan for this module was to make a platformer (similar) to Super Mario Bros. and train a NEAT algorithm on it. Due to the scope and time constraints, I decide to drop that idea and move on to make GOAP in a survival game.\nUnderstanding GOAP # GOAP stands for Goal Oriented Action Planning.\nThe way GOAP works is takes in a starting world state and a goal (target world state). These two, along with a list of all possible actions are sent into the planner. The planner generates a list of actions to take by performing A* search in the actions list based on the preconditions and effect of the provided actions.\nHow I Deal With GOAP # In my implementation of GOAP in Unity. I do not have any classes that define a goal. Everything is defined as a world state.\nC# files for implementing GOAP in Unity Which means the planner takes in the current world state and the target world state (and the actions list).\nThe actions are built by setting preconditions and effects on the world state and by providing a delegate that is executed when an action is executed.\nHere is a snippet of code from my implementation\n// Create a new action called move to drinking point and give it an execution cost GOAP.Action moveToDrinkingPoint = new(\u0026#34;Move to drinking point\u0026#34;, MOVEMENT_COST); // Precondition world state for this action to be executed is that \u0026#39;Player Is Thristy = true\u0026#39; moveToDrinkingPoint.SetPrecondition((int)WorldKey.PlayerIsThristy, true); // The effect of the action on the world state on execution is \u0026#39;Play Is Going To Drink = true\u0026#39; moveToDrinkingPoint.SetEffect((int)WorldKey.PlayerIsGoingToDrink, true); // Set up the function that is called when the action is executed and the function that checks if this action can execute on the current world state (runtime check) moveToDrinkingPoint.SetupExecution( () =\u0026gt; // Execution { m_player.MoveAStar(m_drinkingPoint.transform.position); }, () =\u0026gt; // Checker { // Returns true id the player has reached the drinking point return m_player.HasReachedDestination; }) Like that multiple actions can be set up. The planner then chains them up based on matching preconditions and effects (using A*).\nAction/Goal Chart # Here is a chart showing all the actions and their desired preconditions and effects\nAction/Goal relationship chart Along with GOAP, this project has a comprehensive 2D tilemap terrain analysis system (visualization shown in the cover image)\nCheck out the demo and walkthrough on YouTube Check out the project repository on Github C# Ai Unity Game Development ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/goapai/","section":"Projects","summary":"GOAP in Unity","title":"Goal Oriented Action Planning in Unity"},{"content":"Incognito is a rogue-lite procedural stealth game made in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints. The player playes through a series of rooms (level). After finishing a level, they are brought back to the hub where they can choose weapon and stealth upgrades for their next run. Due to procedural level generation, each level/run is different.\nGame Trailer My Role # This game was made during a university studio simulation module where second and third year students from various fields in game development (design, art, sound, programming) get together to make a game in 6 weeks. The seniors act like deparment leads and the juniors work along with and learn under their guidance.\nThe goal of this module was to make a game in 6 weeks. This game did not have be a complete game, but a vertical slice of a possible game with as many features added that time would allow.\nI was the tech lead and project manager for a team of 22 students. I made the core gameplay systems and the procedural algorithm that generates the map/levels of the game.\nIncogniito Promotional Art My Work # As the Project Manager # As the project manager, my role was to make sure all the other seniors (deparment leads) were on track and make sure the juniors were completing the tasks assigned to them. This was done using Jira to make sure all work was done in time. I also was heavily invovled in deciding the scope of the project.\nAs the Tech Lead # As the tech lead, my role was to design and implement the core gameplay systems and also build a framework easy enough so that the jkuniors can take over along with being designer friendly. Along with feature implementation, I also had to perform version control on the project and handle various department branches and merge conflicts. Most of the version control management was done using command line Git (since handling merge conflicts for UE5 blueprints is a pain).\nManaging the project via Git Procedural Level Generation # Incognito is a stealth game where the levels the user plays (internally referred to as rooms) are generated based on a stripped down version of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Algorithm. All the code for the generation was written in C++ and was highly optimized (100 rooms generated in about 2 seconds).\nGenerating 100 rooms using WFC (for fun) The code was written in such a way that no designer ever had to touch any C++. All required functionality was exposed to the Unreal Editor.\nI provided the designers with a list of templates for each type of room they had to make. All these rooms were then input into a custom data table (written in C++).\nRoom layout template provided to designers The rooms were divided into three types based on the number of openings they had:\nC-Type Rooms: Rooms with 1 opening L-Type Rooms: Rooms with 2 openings adjacent to each other I-Type Rooms: Rooms with 2 openings opposite to each other Each type of room had 4 variants (for every type of rotation). All that was needed to be done was to fill in th neighbor and connections info in the data table. Provide the data table to the generator and generate the level when needed.\nDesigner friendly room layout infographic Additional Work # Enemy Ai # I also worked on other features such as developing the core (3 layer) communication system for all the Ai that was spawned in each room:\nAi-Ai communication: One Ai enemy communicating with other nearby Ai enemies Ai-Room communication: Ai enemies communicating with the room to ambush the player in lockdown mode Room-Level communication: Each room communicated with a game manager gathering telemetry data such as number of enemies killed and how stealthily the player completed a room. This was also used to check if a certain level was finished I also worked on building a base for all Ai enemies, which was later extended by other senior programmers.\nLockdown Mode # One of the most fun features of this game is the Lockdown Mode I helped build with the other senior programmer on the team. It was like a panic mode in the game. If during a player\u0026rsquo;s \u0026rsquo;escape\u0026rsquo; from a room was caught by the Ai. All the enemies in the room would be made aware of the players location and they would collectively attack the player. During this phase, the player no longer has to complete the level stealthily. They have to kill as many enemies, find the key to the exit and leave the room. This intermediate game mode totally changed the way the game is played.\nIf the player managed to find the key and exit the room without killing all the enemies in the room. The next entered room would begin on lockdown mode (keeping in mind player has limited ammo and health)\nDynamic Enemy Wander # One of features I worked on a dynamic enemy wander system. Since all the rooms were pre-built by designers and the generator only placed the room in the game world. If the enemy roaming spots were already pre-defined, the player could simply remember them and easily defeat a room.\nTo counter this, I made use of th Unreal\u0026rsquo;s Environmnet Query System (EQS) to get a random list of wander points based on multiple criterias. These wander points would be randomized and shuffled for each enemy in each room.\nCheck out the project repository on Github Game Unreal Engine C++ Ai Blueprints Team Work Programming Management Design Game Dev ","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/incognito/","section":"Projects","summary":"Procedural rogue-lite game made in UE5","title":"Incognito"},{"content":"This project demonstrates my skills in advanced rendering techniques.

I am Arnav, and you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-talk with me through this page :)\nA picture of me touching grass XD Game Development and Backend Focus # I recently completed my BSc (Hons) Computer Games Design and Programming degree from Staffordshire University (2020-2023). Game development has always been my jam, and I\u0026rsquo;ve had a blast working with Unity and Unreal game engines.\nWhile game development is my passion, I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered a special love for backend development. I\u0026rsquo;m fascinated by the inner workings of game engines, rendering engines, and the tools that power the magic. As part of my final year project, I even built a game engine from scratch, which you can explore in my portfolio.\nI\u0026rsquo;m well-versed in the art of coding and consider C++ and C# to be my trusty sidekicks. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in DirectX 11 and HLSL, which have allowed me to create some complex projects over the years. Along with being well versed in version control tools like Git/Github and project management tools like Jira.\nI thrive on analytical and logical thinking, transforming problem-solving into an exhilarating adventure. With a solid foundation in mathematics, including vector math and the mathematical principles behind graphics programming, I bring a unique perspective to crafting immersive and engaging games that prioritize functionality over aesthetics.\nPassion for Game Jams # In addition to my passion for game development, I absolutely love taking part in game jams. Although I am not much of a gamer myself.\nThese intense and creative events allow me to challenge myself and explore new ideas within tight deadlines. For every game jam that I take part in, I try to learn something new. All my game jam games, although not very fun to play showcase me learning a new feature and trying it out for the first time. I\u0026rsquo;ve had the opportunity to participate in several exciting game jams, including:\n🎮 101 Hours Jam #2 🎮 United Game Jam 2020 🎮 GMTK Game Jam 2020 🎮 Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2 🎮 Discord Game Jam #5 🎮 Ai and Games Jam 2021 🎮 GMTK Game Jam 2021 🎮 Global Game Jam 2021 🎮 Ukie Game Jam 2021 🎮 Global Game Jam 2022\n101 Hours Jam was my first ever game jam. This is also the game jam where I opened Unity for the first time. I ended up learning Unity and making a game in it within the 101 hours Ai and Games Jam was the first game jam where I learn to work with and design complex Ai behaviours (in Unity) using a custom Finite State Machine framework During Global Game Jam 2021 I decided to make a horror game so I could learn advanced sound design in Unity These experiences have been invaluable in sharpening my problem-solving skills, fostering creativity, and collaborating with like-minded individuals. Game jams have pushed me to think on my feet, iterate rapidly, and create unique and memorable game experiences within a limited timeframe.\nI always look forward to the thrill and excitement of game jams, and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to continue participating in these events to further expand my skills and explore the vast possibilities of game development. It also builds my teamworking skills and understanding the different roles in game development.\nLike all programmers I love spending 10 hours automating something I could have manually done in 10 mintues Connect with me on Linkedin ","date":null,"permalink":"/aboutme/","section":"Home","summary":"Introduction # Hey there!","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
