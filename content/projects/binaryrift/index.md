This game was made the for the United Game Jam 2020, who's theme was **Two**. This was my second ever game made in Unity.

In this game, the player controls two characters in different dimensions. The goal of the game is make the two characters reach the end of the level before the red barrier kills them.

In this project I focused on making smooth camera that tracks and encompasses both the players.
