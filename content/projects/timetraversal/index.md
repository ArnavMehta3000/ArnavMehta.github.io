A short puzzle platformer made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2

You play as a bot, whose  goal is to put all the energy cubes into their energy bars, so as to progress to the next level. But here's the catch, you cannot reach some parts of the level. For those areas you have to reverse the time for specific objects, to make them work like moving platforms.
