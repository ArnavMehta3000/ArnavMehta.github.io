---

This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020, where the theme was **Out of Control**. This was my first ever 3D game made in Unity.

In this game, **time** is out of control. The game speeds up and slows down as per the supposed *AI's wish*.

## Images

Here are some screenshots from the game:
