## Introduction

Heylo and welcome to the start of a new project!

As you may have seen from my projects page, I've been tinkering quite a bit into the world of game development, mostly on the low level side of things. Recently I've got the itch to make another game engine from scratch and I figured, why not bring you along for the ride?

So, here we are! I've decided to make use of this blog space on my website to document my journey of yet another game engine.

## Why Document This Journey?

You see, I have a habit of starting projects and abandoning them halfway through. My last ~~documented~~ project was the [game engine I made in my final year of university](https://arnavmehta3000.github.io/projects/proximityengine/). Since then I've attempted to make at least 4 other game engines which have never seen the light of day and all are sitting in private repos. They all have an explosive start, but I end up abandoning them a couple months into the project.

But not this time! I will use this blog basically as an excuse to hold myself accountable with regular updates and posts, I'm gonna stay on track and see this thing through to the end (hopefully ðŸ¤ž).

## What to expect

Well, I'll be sharing everything, from brainstorming sessions, to engine architecture, design decisions and fun C++ tidbits. Some posts might be code-heavy, other might be small bite-sized articles. Let's see how things go :D

## And Finally

Hopefully, the future articles are helpful and enjoyable to read. Keeping in mind it's also my first time writing blogs of any kind, so there is definitly some room for improvement.

I hope you'll stick around for the development of this new project ðŸ˜„.

Catch ya araound!,
Arnav.
