## Introduction

**Hey there! I am Arnav**, and you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-talk with me through this page :)

## Game Development and Backend Focus

I recently completed my **BSc (Hons) Computer Games Design and Programming** degree from **[Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk/)** (2020-2023). Game development has always been my jam, and I've had a blast working with Unity and Unreal game engines.

While game development is my passion, I've discovered a special love for backend development. I'm fascinated by the inner workings of game engines, rendering engines, and the tools that power the magic. As part of my final year project, I even built a game engine from scratch, which you can explore in my portfolio.

I'm well-versed in the art of coding and consider C++ and C# to be my trusty sidekicks. Additionally, I've dabbled in DirectX 11 and HLSL, which have allowed me to create some complex projects over the years. Along with being well versed in version control tools like **Git/Github** and project management tools like **Jira**.

I thrive on *analytical and logical thinking*, transforming problem-solving into an exhilarating adventure. With a solid foundation in mathematics, including *vector math* and the mathematical principles behind *graphics programming*, I bring a unique perspective to crafting immersive and engaging games that prioritize functionality over aesthetics.

## Passion for Game Jams

In addition to my passion for game development, I absolutely love taking part in **game jams**. Although I am not much of a gamer myself.

These intense and creative events allow me to challenge myself and explore new ideas within tight deadlines. For every game jam that I take part in, I try to learn something new. All my game jam games, although not very fun to play showcase me learning a new feature and trying it out for the first time. I've had the opportunity to participate in several exciting game jams, including:

ðŸŽ® 101 Hours Jam #2</br>
ðŸŽ® United Game Jam 2020</br>
ðŸŽ® GMTK Game Jam 2020</br>
ðŸŽ® Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2</br>
ðŸŽ® Discord Game Jam #5</br>
ðŸŽ® Ai and Games Jam 2021</br>
ðŸŽ® GMTK Game Jam 2021</br>
ðŸŽ® Global Game Jam 2021</br>
ðŸŽ® Ukie Game Jam 2021</br>

>- 101 Hours Jam was my first ever game jam. This is also the game jam where I opened Unity for the first time. I ended up learning Unity and making a game in it within the 101 hours
>- Ai and Games Jam was the first game jam where I learn to work with and design complex Ai behaviours (in Unity) using a custom Finite State Machine framework
>- During Global Game Jam 2021 I decided to make a horror game so I could learn advanced sound design in Unity

These experiences have been invaluable in sharpening my problem-solving skills, fostering creativity, and collaborating with like-minded individuals. Game jams have pushed me to think on my feet, iterate rapidly, and create unique and memorable game experiences within a limited timeframe.

I always look forward to the thrill and excitement of game jams, and I'm excited to continue participating in these events to further expand my skills and explore the vast possibilities of game development. It also builds my teamworking skills and understanding the different roles in game development.
